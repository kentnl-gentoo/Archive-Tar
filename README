This is the README file for Archive::Tar, the Perl module for creation
and manipulation of tar files.

This is version 0.072. It fixes a problem with systems that don't like
open files being deleted.  It also has an explicit copyright notice
so folks like Debian can redistribute it in peace, and an new
custodial maintainer due to Calle's suffering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

Get better soon, Calle!

This is version 0.071. It fixes a bunch of bugs, implements POSIX-style
long pathnames and adds a couple of useful methods.  It has also been
verified to work on Win32.

This version also includes a small tar-lookalike program, ptar. There
is no documentation beyond a usage message, but if you've ever used at
Unix-style tar program it should be very familiar.

Unless something really strange and terrible shows up, this will be
the last alpha-test version, and the next release will be beta-test
and v0.50 or something like that.

This module uses no C-coded parts in itself, but it will try to use
the Compress::Zlib module to read and write gzipped tarfiles.
Archive::Tar will still work without Zlib, it will just complain a
little bit (and, of course, not be able to use compression). The
complaining will be removed when the module leaves the alpha stage,
and can be trivially removed by commenting out the offending print
near the top of Tar.pm.

If you use this module at all, please mail me (calle@lysator.liu.se)
and tell me what you think of it.
